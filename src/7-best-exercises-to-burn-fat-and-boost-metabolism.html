							<h6>Why Excess Fat is Dangerous</h6>
							<p>Let’s start with why holding excess fat could be dangerous.</p>
							<p>
								One of the main issues surrounding excess fat is the effect it
								could have on your kidneys. Kidneys help to regulate your blood
								pressure.
							</p>
							<p>
								High blood pressure can lead to various dangerous complications,
								including straining your heart, damaging your blood vessels, and
								increasing the risk of a heart attack.
							</p>
							<p>
								Other complications include the likelihood of suffering a
								stroke, kidney disease, and, unfortunately, in some cases,
								death.
							</p>
							<h6>How Do Our Bodies Burn Fat?</h6>
							<p>
								Before getting into what exercises are best to burn fat and
								boost your metabolism, it's essential to understand how our
								bodies burn fat.
							</p>
							<p>
								When we talk about burning fat, we're generally talking about
								subcutaneous fat, which is the fat that sits just below the
								skin. Depending on the person, the fat can be anywhere from
								centimeters to inches thick.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, we also have to consider visceral fat. This fat sits
								below the abdomen and surrounds the organs, such as the kidneys,
								intestines, lungs, and heart. As this fat builds up, it can
								start to push against your abdomen, which is then what pushes
								your waist or belly out. This is the type of fat that will link
								to diseases and complications.
							</p>
							<p>
								Let's look at the fat-burning process. When you introduce a new
								exercise routine into your life and limit your calories, the
								body does two things to burn fat:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									It will use the energy stored in fat cells to fuel that new
									activity you're introducing to your life.
								</li>
								<li>It will stop putting away excess fat for storage.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>
								When exercising, the brain signals to the fat cells they need to
								release energy packages to the bloodstream. Then, your heart,
								lungs, and muscles will take these fat cells and use them to
								execute activities. Essentially, this leaves those fat cells
								empty, and they become useless to your body. Whatever is left of
								them is released as part of the respiration or urination
								process.
							</p>
							<h4>7 Best Exercises That Burn Fat and Boost Metabolism</h4>
							<img

							<p>
								It's important to remember that there is no singular best form
								of exercise for fat loss or boosting metabolism. Everyone's body
								is different, meaning different types of exercise may work for
								one person and not another. It's a matter of trying them out and
								seeing what works best for you. It could also be a combination
								of all of them. Prioritize the ones you enjoy - this is the best
								way to ensure you'll stick to the plan.
							</p>

							<h6>1. Walking</h6>
							<p>
								This is one of the simplest and most convenient ways to start
								your weight loss journey. It can become a natural part of your
								daily routine. Instead of driving or getting a bus, try walking
								to your destination. Anywhere from 8,000 to 10,000 is a healthy
								amount of steps per day.
							</p>
							<h6>2. Running or Jogging</h6>
							<p>
								These are both great exercises to lose weight, and which you
								choose will depend on how confident of a runner you are. It’s a
								bit of a step up from walking. If you're a beginner, aim to jog
								for 20-30 minutes three or four times a week. Once you’re
								confident, start increasing your pace.
							</p>

							<h6>3. Pilates or Yoga</h6>
							<p>
								Pilates burns fat a bit slower than running, but you're more
								likely to stick to it if you enjoy it. Other benefits include
								improving back pain and strengthening your muscles. Yoga can
								also reduce body fat. It's so good for your mental wellbeing,
								which is necessary for your health journey.
							</p>
							<h6>4. Swimming</h6>
							<p>
								Swimming is a fun low-impact exercise, meaning there will be
								less stress on your joints. You can reduce body fat by swimming
								for 60 minutes 3 times a week. Swimming can also improve your
								flexibility and reduce the risk of heart disease.
							</p>
							<h6>5. Cycling</h6>
							<p>
								Not only is cycling great for weight loss, but it can also be
								really enjoyable. If walking somewhere takes too long, invest in
								a bike. Alternatively, you could use a bike machine at the gym.
								Cycling focuses on your legs and waist and ensures you’re
								walking those areas.
							</p>
							<h6>6. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)</h6>
							<p>
								If you’ve never heard of HIIT exercises, they are short 10-30
								minute workouts that burn calories quickly. You're exercising at
								a higher intensity, but in shorter intervals. It includes a few
								minutes of intense exercise and then slowing down for a bit,
								which you continue on rotation for up to 30 minutes. Start slow
								and build up confidence as you gain fitness and lose weight.
							</p>
							<h6>7. Weight Training</h6>
							<p>
								This type of exercise mainly focuses on your muscles, but
								muscles are one of the biggest organs that will take body fat
								and burn it at a quick rate. If you're considering weight
								training, either invest in a personal trainer or start slowly
								and do research. Don't hurt yourself!
							</p>
							<h6>Conclusion</h6>
							<p>
								And there we have it. That's a fitness breakdown of body fat and
								how we can burn it and boost your metabolism. Remember that the
								journey of weight loss can be challenging, and you shouldn't
								feel disheartened if you don't see progress right away. Make
								sure you’re enjoying whatever exercise you choose, as you’re
								more likely to stick with it!
