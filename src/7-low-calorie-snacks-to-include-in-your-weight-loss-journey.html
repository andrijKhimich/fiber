								7 Low-Calorie Snacks to Include in Your Weight-Loss Journey
							</h3>
							<p>
								You may have been told before that weight loss means a big no to
								snacks. We’re here to tell you that’s not true. Snacks are
								definitely allowed; it’s just about finding ones with low
								calories. It’s helpful to have a list of healthy snacks stocked
								up in your pantry for those little snacks between meals. Learn
								more about how many calories you should have daily for weight
								loss and which low-calorie snacks you can include!

							<h6>How Many Calories You Should Have Per Day For Weight Loss</h6>
							<p>
								As well as exercise, reducing calorie intake is a crucial factor
								in losing weight. However, it’s important to make sure you’re
								doing so safely and healthily. It often depends on your age,
								sex, activity level, and your current weight.
							</p>
							<p>
								The average calorie intake for women is around 2,000 calories.
								To lose weight, you should, on average, reduce your calorie
								intake by 500 to 600 calories. So you’d ideally be looking at
								dropping your daily intake to around 1,200 to 1,500 calories.
							</p>
							<p>
								It varies depending on your age. For example, infants should be
								having 1,000 calories a day. It’s important to reiterate that,
								as adults, we should never be dropping our calorie intake as low
								as a child. On the contrary, between the ages of 16 to 18, our
								calorie intake should be above average.
							</p>
							<p>
								It’s best to either speak to your doctor or use a
								<a
									href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fiber-macro-calculator/id6469620839"
									target="_blank"
									>calorie calculator</a
								>
								to determine what’s best for your age, weight, height, etc.

							<p>
								Let’s get into the delicious and low-calorie snacks you should
								stock up on to help you through your weight loss journey.
							</p>
							<h6>1. Carrots and Hummus</h6>
							<p>
								Not only is this snack full of vitamin A and potassium, but it’s
								also a great low-calorie snack. Better yet, it’s delicious. Half
								a cup of hummus has roughly 200 calories, and eight baby carrots
								will be around 80. Combining the two is a sufficient amount of
								healthy calories for a snack to keep you fueled until your next
								meal.
							</p>

							<h6>2. Popcorn</h6>
							<p>
								When we recommend popcorn, we suggest popping it yourself with
								kernels. Pre-packaged popcorn tends to be full of unnecessary
								additives. If you pop it yourself, you control how much salt and
								oil you add. Homemade popcorn is full of nutrients and vitamins
								and, as it’s a whole-grain food, keeps you full.
							</p>
							<h6>3. Almonds</h6>
							<p>
								Almonds provide a lot of benefits, including fiber and protein.
								This is a super easy and low-maintenance snack, which is handy
								if you’re on the go. You can eat them on their own or pair them
								with other nuts or some dark chocolate for extra flavor.
							</p>
							<h6>4. Pretzels</h6>
							<p>
								Pretzels are low in fat and sugar, and they’re cholesterol-free.
								Make sure you pick up whole grain pretzels as they’re higher in
								fiber and contain less salt than your standard pack of pretzels.
								If you’re good in the kitchen, try making some from scratch!
							</p>
							<h6>5. Yogurt</h6>
							<p>
								Adding low-fat yogurt to your diet can improve your body’s
								ability to burn fat and speed up your metabolism. So, not only
								are you digesting a delicious low-calorie snack, but you’re also
								aiding your weight loss journey.
							</p>

							<h6>6. Grapes</h6>
							<p>
								Despite how sweet grapes are, they’re actually great for a
								low-calorie diet. Adding fruit into your diet is recommended
								anyway, so why not try grapes? They’re also fat-free and have a
								high water content, which will help your body feel fuller.
							</p>

							<h6>7. Apple Slices and Peanut Butter</h6>
							<p>
								Sometimes, we get sick of eating plain food, and that’s fair
								enough! Coating apple slices in peanut butter is a great
								low-calorie alternative to keep snack time exciting and
								satisfying. Both peanut butter and apples have great nutritional
								benefits and will provide plenty of fiber and protein to your
								diet.
							</p>

							<h6>Conclusion</h6>
							<p>
								As you’ll have gathered, snacks are fine so long as you focus on
								low-calorie ones. It’s essential to listen to your body if it’s
								hungry, but perhaps replace chips with carrots and hummus or
								pretzels.
