							<p>
								But before we do, let’s just get one thing straight: Your
								journey shouldn’t be about fitting into society’s beauty
								standards or having a skinny body. Exercise is all about
								embracing and celebrating the amazing body you have right now.
							</p>
							<h6>Why Exercise is Important</h6>
							<p>
								Regular exercise offers a wide variety of benefits, both for
								your physical health and mental well-being, too. From boosting
								your mood and improving the quality of your sleep to improving
								heart health and increasing your energy levels, exercise is a
								powerful tool that can transform your life entirely.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you’re carrying a little extra weight, exercise is an
								important and necessary evil on your journey to a healthier
								lifestyle and a new you.
							</p>
							<p>Exercise also helps you:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Burn extra calories</li>
								<li>Build muscle</li>
								<li>Improve your overall well-being</li>
								<li>Release endorphins that act as a natural mood booster.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Say hello to a more positive outlook on life and goodbye to
								those wobbly bits when you follow our tips and get started on
								your workout routine.
							</p>
							<h6>How to Start an Active and Fit Workout Routine</h6>
							<img
								src="./img/article-1-1.jpg"

							<p>
								Get ready to start your journey to a healthier you as we share a
								few tips to get you started:
							</p>
							<h6>Step #1: Get the Go-Ahead</h6>
							<p>
								It’s always a good idea to chat to your healthcare professional
								or a fitness expert before you start a new workout routine. They
								are best-placed to provide you with valuable insights into any
								potential health issues you may have and can help you tailor
								your workout routine to meet your specific needs and fitness
								goals.
							</p>
							<h6>Step #2: Slow and Steady Always Wins the Race</h6>
							<p>
								There is really no need to rush into a workout routine and push
								your poor body to its limits. Start off slow by doing activities
								that you enjoy and that are gentle on your joints. A few
								low-impact options you can try are walking, swimming, and
								cycling. Ease into these and only incorporate the more intense
								workouts when you are more confident in your abilities and feel
								comfortable with working out.
							</p>
							<h6>Step #3: Mix It Up</h6>
							<p>
								No one is going to be motivated to exercise when they are doing
								that same old thing time and again. Keep your workout and
								fitness journey interesting by trying out a number of
								activities. Try out a dance class, join a yoga class, or drag a
								buddy to the gym with you. Stay engaged and excited by adding a
								bit of spice into your workout routine.
							</p>
							<h6>Step #4: Set Realistic Goals</h6>
							<p>
								Working out without a goal in mind is pointless. Set yourself a
								few goals before you start your fitness journey. It could be a
								distance you want to run, a class you want to join, or toning up
								some of your more “hidden” bits. Celebrate each little milestone
								and keep going.
							</p>
							<h6>Step #5: Listen to Your Body</h6>
							<p>
								Your body is truly unique, so what works for someone else may
								not work for you. Listen to your body and pay attention to the
								little aches and pains that may just crop up while working out.
								If something doesn’t feel right, it is a definite signal to slow
								down and take a break.
							</p>
							<h6>Conclusion</h6>
							<p>
								Your workout journey is all about self-love and well-being.
								Starting an active and fit workout is a fantastic way to embrace
								the incredible person you are and the beautiful body you’re in.
								Remember to start off slow, be patient with yourself, and, most
								of all, enjoy the process. Here’s to a healthier, happier, and
								more active you. You’ve got this!
