								The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR
								require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order

								the following legal bases to process your personal information:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong> Consent.</strong> We may process your information if
									you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your

									your consent at any time. Learn more about
									<a href="#">withdrawing your consent.</a>

									legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in
									litigation in which we are involved.

								We may process your information if you have given us specific

								information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your
								permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can
								<a href="#">withdraw your consent </a>at any time.
							</p>
							<p>
								In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under
								applicable law to process your information without your consent,
								including, for example:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and
									consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
								</li>
								<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
								<li>
									For business transactions provided certain conditions are met
								</li>
								<li>
									If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection
									is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
								</li>
								<li>
									For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and
									communicating with next of kin
								</li>
								<li>
									If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has
									been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
								</li>
								<li>
									If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent
									would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the
									information and the collection is reasonable for purposes
									related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a
									contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
								</li>
								<li>
									If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant,
									court order, or rules of the court relating to the production
									of records

							</p>
							<p>
								When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
								personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
								information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because
								your personal information has been stored in backup archives),

								to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is

							<p>
								Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your

								the information in our system. These verification efforts
								require us to ask you to provide information so that we can
								match it with information you have previously provided us. For
								instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may
								ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
								information you provide with the information we already have on
								file, or we may contact you through a communication method
								(e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us.
								We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances
								dictate.
							</p>
							<p>
								We will only use personal information provided in your request
								to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the
								extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information
								from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot
								verify your identity from the information already maintained by
								us, we may request that you provide additional information for
								the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
								fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally
								provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
